# Svelte & Express Sample

This is my personal exercise project to get to know Svelte and Express.js better.

## How to start the project

1. Create `configurations` folder in `./api/` with two env files and insert your configuration values
   - `auth0.env`
   - `cosmosdb.env`
2. Start the Express API by executing the following command in the `./api/` folder:
   `npm run start:watch`
3. Start the Svelte App by executing the following command in the `./app/` folder:
   `npm run dev`
